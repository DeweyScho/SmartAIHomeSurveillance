# SmartAIHomeSurveillance

This team-oriented project was an AI-driven home security system that performs facial recognition, behavior detection, and sends real-time mobile alerts 

- **Facial Recognition:** Uses DeepFace and OpenCV to detect and identify known individuals.
- **Behavior Detection:** Flags loitering, restricted area access, and unusual activity using pattern analysis.
- **Real-Time Alerts:** Sends instant image-based alerts via Telegram with interactive response options.
- **Local Processing:** All data is processed and stored locally on a Raspberry Pi; no cloud storage required.
- **Affordable Build:** Built under a $250 hardware budget using open-source Python libraries.
